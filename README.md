## AVCapture <a name="section-1"></a>
The AVFoundation Capture subsystem offers a unified framework for handling video, photo, and audio capture functions across iOS and macOS. Utilize this system to:
- Craft a personalized camera interface, seamlessly integrating photo and video shooting within your app's interface.
- Empower users with greater control over capture settings like focus, exposure, and stabilization.
- Generate unique outcomes, such as RAW format images, depth maps, or videos featuring custom timed metadata, differing from the default camera interface.
- Access live pixel or audio data directly from the capture device.

Key components of this architecture include sessions, inputs, and outputs. Sessions establish connections between inputs (like built-in cameras and microphones) and outputs, which process media from inputs into useful data, such as movie files or raw pixel buffers.
